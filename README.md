# Chastity's Assembly Library

All of Chastity's best Assembly Language Code

This repository is intended to help me as I teach other people the little bit I know about Assembly Language.

Obviously this will be mostly Intel CPU Assembly because I know it the best. However, I am open to experimenting with other architectures for fun.

One of the unique things about Assembly is that there are no default input and output routines. This means that the user has to write their own, unless someone is kind enough to provide theirs.

But my purpose isn't just to provide functions you can include and call, my goal is to help you actually understand why they work as they do. To accomplish this, I may have to record videos explaining it or at least write good documentation on how it operates.

More will be written later! Feel free to browse the code I have up so far!
