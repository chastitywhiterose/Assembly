Chastity's DOS Interrupt List

First, let me say that credit goes to Ralph Brown for providing his list of PC interrupts to the world for free. I have extracted the most important of these interrupts for the DOS programming I will be doing.

The following Interrupts are hand picked by Chastity for their usefulness in reading and writing characters in text based DOS programs.


--------D-2100-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 1+ - TERMINATE PROGRAM
	AH = 00h
	CS = PSP segment
Notes:	Microsoft recommends using INT 21/AH=4Ch for DOS 2+
	this function sets the program's return code (ERRORLEVEL) to 00h
	execution continues at the address stored in INT 22 after DOS performs
	  whatever cleanup it needs to do (restoring the INT 22,INT 23,INT 24
	  vectors from the PSP assumed to be located at offset 0000h in the
	  segment indicated by the stack copy of CS, etc.)
	if the PSP is its own parent, the process's memory is not freed; if
	  INT 22 additionally points into the terminating program, the
	  process is effectively NOT terminated
	not supported by MS Windows 3.0 DOSX.EXE DOS extender
SeeAlso: AH=26h,AH=31h,AH=4Ch,INT 20,INT 22

--------D-2101-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 1+ - READ CHARACTER FROM STANDARD INPUT, WITH ECHO
	AH = 01h
Return: AL = character read
Notes:	^C/^Break are checked, and INT 23 executed if read
	^P toggles the DOS-internal echo-to-printer flag
	^Z is not interpreted, thus not causing an EOF if input is redirected
	character is echoed to standard output
	standard input is always the keyboard and standard output the screen
	  under DOS 1.x, but they may be redirected under DOS 2+

--------D-2102-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 1+ - WRITE CHARACTER TO STANDARD OUTPUT
	AH = 02h
	DL = character to write
Return: AL = last character output (despite the official docs which state
		nothing is returned) (at least DOS 2.1-7.0)
Notes:	^C/^Break are checked, and INT 23 executed if pressed
	standard output is always the screen under DOS 1.x, but may be
	  redirected under DOS 2+
	the last character output will be the character in DL unless DL=09h
	  on entry, in which case AL=20h as tabs are expanded to blanks
	if standard output is redirected to a file, no error checks (write-
	  protected, full media, etc.) are performed
SeeAlso: AH=06h,AH=09h

--------D-2109-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 1+ - WRITE STRING TO STANDARD OUTPUT
	AH = 09h
	DS:DX -> '$'-terminated string
Return: AL = 24h (the '$' terminating the string, despite official docs which
		state that nothing is returned) (at least DOS 2.1-7.0 and
		NWDOS)
Notes:	^C/^Break are checked, and INT 23 is called if either pressed
	standard output is always the screen under DOS 1.x, but may be
	  redirected under DOS 2+
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
SeeAlso: AH=02h,AH=06h"OUTPUT"

--------D-2139-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "MKDIR" - CREATE SUBDIRECTORY
	AH = 39h
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ pathname
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX destroyed
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (03h,05h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	all directories in the given path except the last must exist
	fails if the parent directory is the root and is full
	DOS 2.x-3.3 allow the creation of a directory sufficiently deep that
	  it is not possible to make that directory the current directory
	  because the path would exceed 64 characters
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
SeeAlso: AH=3Ah,AH=3Bh,AH=6Dh,AX=7139h,AH=E2h/SF=0Ah,AX=43FFh/BP=5053h
SeeAlso: INT 2F/AX=1103h,INT 60/DI=0511h

--------D-213A-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "RMDIR" - REMOVE SUBDIRECTORY
	AH = 3Ah
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ pathname of directory to be removed
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX destroyed
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (03h,05h,06h,10h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	directory must be empty (contain only '.' and '..' entries)
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
SeeAlso: AH=39h,AH=3Bh,AX=713Ah,AH=E2h/SF=0Bh,INT 2F/AX=1101h,INT 60/DI=0512h

--------D-213B-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "CHDIR" - SET CURRENT DIRECTORY
	AH = 3Bh
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ pathname to become current directory (max 64 bytes)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX destroyed
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (03h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	if new directory name includes a drive letter, the default drive is
	  not changed, only the current directory on that drive
	changing the current directory also changes the directory in which
	  FCB file calls operate
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
SeeAlso: AH=47h,AX=713Bh,INT 2F/AX=1105h

--------D-213C-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "CREAT" - CREATE OR TRUNCATE FILE
	AH = 3Ch
	CX = file attributes (see #01401)
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = file handle
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (03h,04h,05h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	if a file with the given name exists, it is truncated to zero length
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
	DR DOS checks the system password or explicitly supplied password at
	  the end of the filename against the reserved field in the directory
	  entry before allowing access
SeeAlso: AH=16h,AH=3Dh,AH=5Ah,AH=5Bh,AH=93h,INT 2F/AX=1117h

Bitfields for file attributes:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 01401)
 0	read-only
 1	hidden
 2	system
 3	volume label (ignored)
 4	reserved, must be zero (directory)
 5	archive bit
 7	if set, file is shareable under Novell NetWare

--------D-213D-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "OPEN" - OPEN EXISTING FILE
	AH = 3Dh
	AL = access and sharing modes (see #01402)
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename
	CL = attribute mask of files to look for (server call only)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = file handle
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,02h,03h,04h,05h,0Ch,56h) (see #01680 at AH=59h)
Notes:	file pointer is set to start of file
	if SHARE or a network is loaded, the file open may fail if the file
	  is already open, depending on the combination of sharing modes
	  (see #01403,#01404)
	file handles which are inherited from a parent also inherit sharing
	  and access restrictions
	files may be opened even if given the hidden or system attributes
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
	DR DOS checks the system password or explicitly supplied password at
	  the end of the filename (following a semicolon) against the reserved
	  field in the directory entry before allowing access
	sharing modes are only effective on local drives if SHARE is loaded
BUG:	Novell DOS 7 SHARE v1.00 would refuse file access in the cases in
	  #01403 marked with [1] (read-only open of a read-only file
	  which had previously been opened in compatibility mode); this was
	  fixed in SHARE v1.01 of 09/29/94
SeeAlso: AH=0Fh,AH=3Ch,AX=4301h,AX=5D00h,INT 2F/AX=1116h,INT 2F/AX=1226h

Bitfields for access and sharing modes:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 01402)
 2-0	access mode
	000 read only
	001 write only
	010 read/write
	011 (DOS 5+ internal) passed to redirector on EXEC to allow
		case-sensitive filenames
 3	reserved (0)
 6-4	sharing mode (DOS 3.0+) (see #01403)
	000 compatibility mode
	001 "DENYALL" prohibit both read and write access by others
	010 "DENYWRITE" prohibit write access by others
	011 "DENYREAD" prohibit read access by others
	100 "DENYNONE" allow full access by others
	111 network FCB (only available during server call)
 7	inheritance
	if set, file is private to current process and will not be inherited
	  by child processes

Legend: R -> reading, W -> writing, RW -> both reading & writing,

	Y = open succeeds, N = open fails with error code 05h
	C = open fails, INT 24 generated
SeeAlso: #01403,#01636

--------D-213E-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "CLOSE" - CLOSE FILE
	AH = 3Eh
	BX = file handle
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX destroyed
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	if the file was written to, any pending disk writes are performed, the
	  time and date stamps are set to the current time, and the directory
	  entry is updated
	recent versions of DOS preserve AH because some versions of Multiplan
	  had a bug which depended on AH being preserved
SeeAlso: AH=10h,AH=3Ch,AH=3Dh,INT 2F/AX=1106h,INT 2F/AX=1227h

--------D-213F-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "READ" - READ FROM FILE OR DEVICE
	AH = 3Fh
	BX = file handle
	CX = number of bytes to read
	DS:DX -> buffer for data
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = number of bytes actually read (0 if at EOF before call)
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (05h,06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	data is read beginning at current file position, and the file position
	  is updated after a successful read
	the returned AX may be smaller than the request in CX if a partial
	  read occurred
	if reading from CON, read stops at first CR
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
BUG:	Novell NETX.EXE v3.26 and 3.31 do not set CF if the read fails due to
	  a record lock (see AH=5Ch), though it does return AX=0005h; this
	  has been documented by Novell
SeeAlso: AH=27h,AH=40h,AH=93h,INT 2F/AX=1108h,INT 2F/AX=1229h

--------D-2140-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "WRITE" - WRITE TO FILE OR DEVICE
	AH = 40h
	BX = file handle
	CX = number of bytes to write
	DS:DX -> data to write
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = number of bytes actually written
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (05h,06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	if CX is zero, no data is written, and the file is truncated or
	  extended to the current position
	data is written beginning at the current file position, and the file
	  position is updated after a successful write
	for FAT32 drives, the file must have been opened with AX=6C00h with
	  the "extended size" flag in order to expand the file beyond 2GB;
	  otherwise the write will fail with error code 0005h (access denied)
	the usual cause for AX < CX on return is a full disk
BUG:	a write of zero bytes will appear to succeed when it actually failed
	  if the write is extending the file and there is not enough disk
	  space for the expanded file (DOS 5.0-6.0); one should therefore check
	  whether the file was in fact extended by seeking to 0 bytes from
	  the end of the file (INT 21/AX=4202h/CX=0000h/DX=0000h)
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
SeeAlso: AH=28h,AH=3Fh"DOS",AH=93h,INT 2F/AX=1109h

--------D-2141-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "UNLINK" - DELETE FILE
	AH = 41h
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename (no wildcards, but see notes)
	CL = attribute mask for deletion (server call only, see notes)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX destroyed (DOS 3.3) AL seems to be drive of deleted file
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (02h,03h,05h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	(DOS 3.1+) wildcards are allowed if invoked via AX=5D00h, in which case
	  the filespec must be canonical (as returned by AH=60h), and only
	  files matching the attribute mask in CL are deleted
	DR DOS 5.0-6.0 returns error code 03h if invoked via AX=5D00h; DR DOS
	  3.41 crashes if called via AX=5D00h with wildcards
	DOS does not erase the file's data; it merely becomes inaccessible
	  because the FAT chain for the file is cleared
	deleting a file which is currently open may lead to filesystem
	  corruption.  Unless SHARE is loaded, DOS does not close the handles
	  referencing the deleted file, thus allowing writes to a nonexistant
	  file.
	under DR DOS and DR Multiuser DOS, this function will fail if the file
	  is currently open
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
BUG:	DR DOS 3.41 crashes if called via AX=5D00h
SeeAlso: AH=13h,AX=4301h,AX=4380h,AX=5D00h,AH=60h,AX=7141h,AX=F244h
SeeAlso: INT 2F/AX=1113h

--------D-2142-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "LSEEK" - SET CURRENT FILE POSITION
	AH = 42h
	AL = origin of move
	    00h start of file
	    01h current file position
	    02h end of file
	BX = file handle
	CX:DX = (signed) offset from origin of new file position
Return: CF clear if successful
	    DX:AX = new file position in bytes from start of file
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	for origins 01h and 02h, the pointer may be positioned before the
	  start of the file; no error is returned in that case (except under
	  Windows NT), but subsequent attempts at I/O will produce errors
	if the new position is beyond the current end of file, the file will
	  be extended by the next write (see AH=40h); for FAT32 drives, the
	  file must have been opened with AX=6C00h with the "extended size"
	  flag in order to expand the file beyond 2GB
BUG:	using this method to grow a file from zero bytes to a very large size
	  can corrupt the FAT in some versions of DOS; the file should first
	  be grown from zero to one byte and then to the desired large size
SeeAlso: AH=24h,INT 2F/AX=1228h

--------D-214300-----------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - GET FILE ATTRIBUTES
	AX = 4300h
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename
Return: CF clear if successful
	    CX = file attributes (see #01420)
	    AX = CX (DR DOS 5.0)
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,02h,03h,05h) (see #01680 at AH=59h)
Notes:	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the filename pointer is in DS:EDX
	under DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0, attempts to change the subdirectory bit are
	  simply ignored without an error
BUG:	Windows for Workgroups returns error code 05h (access denied) instead
	  of error code 02h (file not found) when attempting to get the
	  attributes of a nonexistent file.  This causes open() with O_CREAT
	  and fopen() with the "w" mode to fail in Borland C++.
SeeAlso: AX=4301h,AX=4310h,AX=7143h,AH=B6h,INT 2F/AX=110Fh,INT 60/DI=0517h
--------D-214301-----------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "CHMOD" - SET FILE ATTRIBUTES
	AX = 4301h
	CX = new file attributes (see #01420)
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX destroyed
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,02h,03h,05h) (see #01680 at AH=59h)
Notes:	will not change volume label or directory attribute bits, but will
	  change the other attribute bits of a directory (the directory
	  bit must be cleared to successfully change the other attributes of a
	  directory, but the directory will not be changed to a normal file as
	  a result)
	MS-DOS 4.01 reportedly closes the file if it is currently open
	for security reasons, the Novell NetWare execute-only bit can never
	  be cleared; the file must be deleted and recreated
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the filename pointer is in DS:EDX
	DOS 5.0 SHARE will close the file if it is currently open in sharing-
	  compatibility mode, otherwise a sharing violation critical error is
	  generated if the file is currently open
	DR DOS 3.41/5.0 will silently ignore attempts to change the 'directory'
	  attribute bit
SeeAlso: AX=4300h,AX=4311h,AX=7143h,INT 2F/AX=110Eh

Bitfields for file attributes:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 01420)
 7	shareable (Novell NetWare)
 7	pending deleted files (Novell DOS, OpenDOS)
 6	unused
 5	archive
 4	directory
 3	volume label
	execute-only (Novell NetWare)
 2	system
 1	hidden
 0	read-only

--------D-214C-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "EXIT" - TERMINATE WITH RETURN CODE
	AH = 4Ch
	AL = return code
Return: never returns
Notes:	unless the process is its own parent
	  (see #01378 [offset 16h] at AH=26h), all open files are closed and
	  all memory belonging to the process is freed
	all network file locks should be removed before calling this function
